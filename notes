Steps

1. start.spring.io -> details and dependencies
2. Unzipped downloaded project
3. Opened in intelliJ
4. DB connection details
5. Start coding

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update || create || verify

update -> everytime we run the system, only new changes are updated
create -> everytime we run this system, drop all the tables and then re-create them with current changes
verify -> verify whether the DB has required tables and columns as per entities

For all dependent objects -> we use annotation called @Component
but if they also do something -> @Repository, @Service

For controllers which supports RestAPIs -> @RestController
For simple controllers which does not support RESTAPIs -> @Controller

DTOs are supposed to be used for Controller layer only, service and repository layer should not deal with
DTOs, they should only deal with internal models.

User 1:M -> ticket

1 user
<1,2,3,4,5>

B user
5

Ticket table
ticketId, userId
B           5

-> Controller to be updated.
