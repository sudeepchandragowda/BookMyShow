Steps

1. start.spring.io -> details and dependencies
2. Unzipped downloaded project
3. Opened in intelliJ
4. DB connection details
5. Start coding

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update || create || verify

update -> everytime we run the system, only new changes are updated
create -> everytime we run this system, drop all the tables and then re-create them with current changes
verify -> verify whether the DB has required tables and columns as per entities

For all dependent objects -> we use annotation called @Component
but if they also do something -> @Repository, @Service

For controllers which supports RestAPIs -> @RestController
For simple controllers which does not support RESTAPIs -> @Controller
